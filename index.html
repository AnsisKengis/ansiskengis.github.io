        The technique works because when both margins are set to auto, web browsers are required by the
        CSS
        standard to give them equal width. This is why you also have to specify the width of the DIV
        block,
        since browsers will otherwise set it to 100% of the available space. If all the space is
        occupied by
        the block, there's no need to centre it. Centring is only relevant if an object is smaller than
        the
        space around it.
        Incidentally, the width doesn't need to be in pixels. Other units like em or percentage will
        work
        just as well.
