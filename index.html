                    The technique works because when both margins are set to auto, web browsers are required by the CSS standard to give them equal width. This is why you also have to specify the width of the DIV block, since browsers will otherwise set it to 100% of the available space. If all the space is occupied by the block, there's no need to centre it. Centring is only relevant if an object is smaller than the space around it.
                    Incidentally, the width doesn't need to be in pixels. Other units like em or percentage will work just as well.
